## Nilearn Dev Days 2020

[Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io) is a python tool that has historically focused on statistical learning with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.
With the recent merge of the [Nistats](https://nistats.github.io) code base,
the Niearn mission statement has been revised and expanded:

> Nilearn enables **approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes**.
> It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with **instructive documentation & a friendly community**.

In the 2020 Dev Days, we hope to increase the awareness of Nilearn's development philosophy and onboard new contributors to our community.
We also hope to highlight future directions where we are especially excited to see community-driven development efforts.

## Schedule

The Dev Days will be structured as **a four-day event from 19-22 May**, all occurring online:
